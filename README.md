# Investigating-Fandango-Movie-Ratings

I explored the rating differences for popular movies between 2015 and 2016 years from Fandango website. I used pandas to open and obtain data. I pulled the data from 2 different data set. I used entries only for 2015 and 2016 years. I studied on only ratings for this project. I used numpy and matplotlib to visualize the results.


## Conclusion

There is a difference between two years. In 2016, the ratings are less than the ratings in 2015. The median of ratings are same. The mode of ratings of 2015 is 0.5 point more than the mode of ratings of 2016. The difference is aproximately 0.05 point between the means. The mean of ratings of 2015 is much than the mean of ratings of 2016.
