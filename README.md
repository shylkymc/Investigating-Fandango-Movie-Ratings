# Investigating-Fandango-Movie-Ratings

I explored the rating differences for popular movies between 2015 and 2016 from the Fandango website. I used Pandas to open and obtain data. I pulled the data from 2 different data sets. I used entries only for 2015 and 2016. I used only ratings for this project. I used Numpy and Matplotlib to visualize the results.


## Conclusion

There is a difference between the two years. In 2016, the ratings are less than the ratings in 2015. The median of ratings are the same. The mode of ratings for 2015 is 0.5 and more than the mode of ratings for 2016. The difference is approximately 0.05 between the means. The mean of ratings of 2015 is more than the mean of ratings of 2016.
